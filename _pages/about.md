I hold a master's degree in electrical engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), where my focus was on wireless resource management within wireless networks. Prior to my master's studies, I pursued my bachelor's degree at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/).

With a profound interest in computer science applications within wireless communication, I am keenly interested in exploring the intersection of these two fields. My passion lies in delving into topics such as machine learning, reinforcement learning, and game theory within the domain of wireless communication systems.
